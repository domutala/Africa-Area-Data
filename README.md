## Africa Area Data

**Africa Area Data** is an **open-source project** aimed at centralizing, structuring, and making accessible the **administrative geographic data of Africa**, from the largest divisions (countries, regions, departments) to the smallest (communes, districts, villages, neighborhoods, etc.) in a **standardized and easily usable JSON format**.

### Goal

Administrative data in Africa is often **hard to find**, **incomplete**, or **scattered across multiple official and unofficial sources**.
This project aims to:

* **Collect** reliable geographic data for each African country;
* **Standardize** JSON structures to make them easy to use for developers, researchers, and institutions;
* **Share openly** to promote transparency, research, and innovation with open data in Africa.

### Possible Uses

* Mapping and GIS (Geographic Information Systems)
* Development of government or civic applications
* Data science and territorial analysis projects
* Visualization and geolocation of public infrastructure
* Demographic, electoral, or economic studies

### Contribution

Contributions are **welcome from everyone**!
You can:

* Add or correct data for a country;
* Improve the JSON file structures;
* Help with documentation and source validation.

### Vision

To create **the largest open-source geographic database of the African continent**, reliable, accessible, and interoperable, supporting technological development and territorial knowledge across Africa.
